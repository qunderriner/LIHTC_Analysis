# LIHTC_Analysis
See PDF extraction repo (https://github.com/qunderriner/PDF_Extraction) for much of the data collection work. 

LIHTC Graphs .ipynb - code for stacked bar charts QU added to google doc on dec 18th that shows different funding sources for projects. Note, altair graphs 
don't always load on github, can run locally or see charts in google doc. Lamp_Lodge_perm.csv and comparison_file_LIHTC_for_Zach.csv are the two small csvs that power
these graphs and they are here in the aux_data file. 

SyndicatorData_find_average_unit_cost_EK.ipynb - small exploratory file QU made for EK to see if we could predict 9% vs. 4% by avearge unit cost (to be able to predict new construciton vs. rehab. initial attempts did not work well)>
