# LIHTC_Analysis
See PDF extraction repo (https://github.com/qunderriner/PDF_Extraction) for much of the data collection work. 

LIHTC Graphs .ipynb - code for stacked bar charts QU added to google doc on dec 18th that shows different funding sources for projects. Note, altair graphs 
don't always load on github, can run locally or see charts in google doc. Lamp_Lodge_perm.csv and comparison_file_LIHTC_for_Zach.csv are the two small csvs that power these graphs and they are here in the aux_data file. 

SyndicatorData_Graphs.ipynb - Code for a subset of syndicator graphs added to google doc Dec 18th. Line charts, with estimates of 9% projects, that examine cost per unit and number of sources over time. Also done in altair so may not render on github. Three small syndicator data files needed to run this, syndicator B, I, add G, can be found in the aux_data.

Exploratory_Analysis_v3_CLEAN.ipynb - latest exploratory work of scraped LIHTC datafiles. Graphs also in altair. The four csvs needed to run this file, "Ohio_LIHTC_Approved_9%_augmented.csv", Georgia_LIHTC_Approved_9%_augmented.csv, California_LIHTC_Nine_Percent_augmented.csv, and Virginia_LIHTC_Approved_9%.csv are in the aux_date file. 

SyndicatorData_find_average_unit_cost_EK.ipynb - small exploratory file QU made for EK to see if we could predict 9% vs. 4% by average unit cost (to be able to predict new construction vs. rehab. initial attempts did not work well).
